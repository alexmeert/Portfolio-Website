# Portfolio Website
Modeled after a tutorial from GreatStack: https://youtu.be/0YFrGy_mzjY?si=-oMuRHhghRYvOrkk

My personal portfolio website is built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It contains everything there is to know about me and acts as a hub for all my links, projects, social media, and general info!
